HOW TO PLAY

Choose a slingshot to hit a can! The yellow slingshot gives you 1 point and the green one gives 2 points to other player.

The aim of this game is to hit as many cans as possible. Players can double their points if they play together, but there is a risk of being defected and, hence, getting no points!

There will be different cans configurations for each level changing difficulty and possible scores.
